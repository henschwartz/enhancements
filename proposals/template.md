# Title

## What?

Brief description of the feature or change.

### Goals

- Goal 1
- Goal 2

## Why?

### Motivation

Why this change is needed.

### User Stories

- As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit].

## How?

> **Note:** do not include this section in the first
> PR. Submit What? and Why? first. Add How? in a
> follow-up PR after the proposal direction is
> accepted.

### Experimental Phase

> Before implementation begins, prototype in the
> [experimental repo]. Add the `experimental_impl`
> field to frontmatter once the prototype is ready.
>
> If this proposal cannot use the experimental repo
> (e.g. core infrastructure, operator changes), set
> `experimental_exempt: true` and provide a reason.
> See [experimental-phase.md] for details.
